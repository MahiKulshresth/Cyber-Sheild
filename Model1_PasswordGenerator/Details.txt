This Python code uses Tkinter to create a user-friendly window for collecting password requirements.
It includes input fields for minimum and maximum password length, and checkboxes for selecting uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters. 
When users click "Generate Password," it constructs a dictionary with their choices and calls a function to create a password. 
The generated password is then displayed in the window. Overall, it offers a simple and intuitive interface for customizing and generating passwords.
